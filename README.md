# Prediction-student-performance
In this repo I will build two prediction models. 
I do this with the help of a book called 'Python Artificial Intelligence projects for beginners'.
So in this project I will explore classification using Machine Learning algorithms.

## Algorithms 
1) Decision trees 
This is one of the simplest techniques for classification. They can be compared with a game of 20 questions. 
Each node in the tree is either leaf node or a question node.

2) Random Forest
I will use random forest to predict a bird's species. I use the dataset of Caltech-UC San Diego.
Random forest is a collection of decision trees. Each tree is only allowed to look at some of the attributes. 
Normally this is a small number relative to the total number of attributes.
